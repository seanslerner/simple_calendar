Simple Calendar
===============

This is a small Rails 3.x gem for creating a quick and clean table calendar.
Theming is up to you, but it works nicely with Twitter Bootstrap.

Installation
------------

Just add this into your Gemfile followed by a bundle install:

    gem "simple_calendar", "~> 0.0.4"

Usage
-----

Here we have a model called Event with the start_time attribute that we
will be using with simple_calendar.

    class Event < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_calendar
    end

We query the events we want to display as usual, and then render the
calendar in the view like so:

    <%= calendar @events do |event| %>
      <div><%= link_to event.title, event %></div>
    <% end %>

When the calendar is rendering, it yields to the block to allow you to
render whatever you like for the item. In this example, I use the title
attribute on the event with a link to the event.

has_calendar has options that can be passed to it for configuration:

    has_calendar :start_time => :my_start_column

The start_time option is the field for the start time of the event. This will use
my_start_column to determine which day to render the event on.


CSS
---

You will probably want to customize the height of the calendar so that
all the rows are the same. You can do this by adding the following line
to your css:

  .calendar td { height: 100px; width: 14.28%; }

By default simple_calendar will set the calendar to use .bordered-table
and .calendar classes.

TODO
====

* Add query helpers to grab events for a current month and the days into
  the next and previous months for efficiency
* Customizable starting day of week
* More customization?
